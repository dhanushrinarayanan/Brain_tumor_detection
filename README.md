# Brain_tumor_detection
Brain tumor detection and classification are critical for early diagnosis and effective treatment planning. The Hybrid CNN Model combines the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with additional techniques such as transfer learning, ensemble learning, or attention mechanisms to enhance accuracy and robustness. The model processes MRI scans, extracting deep features for precise tumor identification and classification into categories like benign, malignant, or normal. By leveraging multi-layer feature extraction, it improves diagnostic performance, reduces false positives, and aids radiologists in making informed decisions.
